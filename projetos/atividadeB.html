    <h1>The Beach</h1>
    <p>If I told you that I loved you <br>
        Tell me, what would you say? <br>
        If I told you that I hated you <br>
        Would you go away? <br>
        Now I need your help with everything that I do <br>
        I don't want to lie, I've been relying on you </p>
        <p>
            Fallin' again, I need a pick-me-up <br>
            I've been callin' you friend, I might need to give it up </p>
        <p>
            I'm sick and I'm tired, too  <br>
            I can admit, I am not fireproof  <br>
            I feel it burning me <br>
            I feel it burning you <br>
            I hope I don't murder me <br>
            I hope I don't burden you <br>
            If I do, if I do </p>

    <p>If I meet you in the middle, maybe we could agree <br>
        You make me feel little how you're looking at me <br>
        And you can throw me shade, all it does is just cool me off<br>
        First it just threw me off, now I'm just moving on</p>

        <p>Fallin' again, I need a pick-me-up <br>
            I've been callin' you friend, I might need to give it up</p>

        <p>I'm sick and I'm tired, too <br>
        I can admit, I am not fireproof <br>
        I feel it burning me <br>
        I feel it burning you <br>
        I hope I don't murder me <br>
        I hope I don't burden you</p>
        
        <p>Swim with me <br>
            I think I can see the beach <br>
            I know what's underneath<br>
            I need you here with me<br>
            But we're out in the open</p>

        <p>Swim with me <br>
            I think I can see the beach <br>
            Just don't look underneath us <br>
            I need you here with me <br>
            But we're out in the open</p>

      <p> I'm sick and I'm tired, too <br>
        I can admit, I am not fireproof <br>
        I feel it burning me <br>
        I feel it burning you<br>
        I hope I don't murder me<br>
        I hope I don't burden you<br>
        If I do, if I do<br>
        (If I do, if I do) </p>
